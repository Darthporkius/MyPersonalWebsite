                <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! 
                It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? 
                He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! 
                I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. 
                They called me Mr Glass.Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. 
                Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. 
                That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. 
                We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. 
                However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.
                </p>
                <p>Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. 
                You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! 
                Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. 
                And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. 
                Computer, lights up! The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. 
                Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. 
                The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, 
                fourteen kiloquad interface modules.
